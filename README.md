# Volume Pump Thing

a stupid little python game where you gotta keep clicking to pump up the volume

## what it does
- click the button to pump air into the balloon
- volume goes up when you click
- slowly decreases when you stop
- balloon changes color based on volume level
- has a wobble effect that looks kinda cool

## how to run
just run the python file lol
```
python volume_pump.py
```

needs tkinter but that usually comes with python

## why i made this
idk was bored and thought it would be funny to make volume control annoying

## colors
- blue = low volume
- green = medium 
- orange = getting loud
- red = max volume
